# Flask Models Lab & Homework

Your task is to model a Flask app which will list customer orders for an online shop. What the shop sells is up to you! (Could be books, games, food, etc)

## MVP

Your application should have a single class - Order - and should contain at least the following properties:
* customer_name
* order_date
* quantity

And any other relevant properties such as:
* book_title/game_title
* food_topping
* description


Provide the following functionality in the web app:

* List all orders

### Extensions

* Create a new route to display one order. You can use the index number to obtain the order from the list. 
    * Route will be a `GET` route to `/orders/<index>`
    * Create a new template called `order.html`
    * Add a link, (`<a></a>`), to each order in the list to take you to the approriate view for that orders details.
    

## Extra Extra!

A some CSS to your app.

### Styling

To style a Flask app you will need to put your CSS files inside a folder called `static` inside the root directory.

Then add the following line inside the <HEAD> tag of your HTML pages.

```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='your_file_name.css') }}">
```


#### Guidance

Make sure to include `__init__.py` files in your packages (folders)

Follow RESTful convention for your routes.
