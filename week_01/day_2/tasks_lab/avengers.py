# Task
# Make a dictionary called avengers. It should contain keys for Iron Man and Hulk.
# Each avenger is represented by another dictionary, and has a name (Tony Stark and Bruce Banner respectively) and another dictionary containing their attacks.
# Each attack should have an int value of the attackâ€™s power. Iron man can punch (10) and kick (100) and Hulk can smash (1000) and roll (500).
# Once you have created the dictionary, retrieve and print out the attack power of Hulks smash move.
