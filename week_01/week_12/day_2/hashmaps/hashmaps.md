## Learning Objectives

- Describe the purpose of a HashMap
- Use some important HashMap methods
- Use a HashMap in your projects

### Intro

When we were learning Python, we saw how useful it was to store keys and values in a structured way - using dictionaries:

```python
  person_dict = { name: "Sal", occupation: "pizza chef" }
```

It allowed us to store and retrieve data without having to worry about the *order* of the data.

Most languages have a similar construct, and in Java, these are called HashMaps. (In other languages they might be called hashes, dictionaries, or associative arrays.)

Let's look at how we would initialise a HashMap in Java.

Create a new project in IntelliJ and call it HashMapDemo.

Create a new Java class in the main package again called HashMapDemo.

```java
  // HashMapDemo.java
  import java.util.HashMap;

  public class HashMapDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      HashMap favouriteFruits = new HashMap();

      favouriteFruits.put("Alice", "Apple");
      favouriteFruits.put("Sarah", "Banana");
      favouriteFruits.put("Bob", "Strawberry");

      System.out.println(favouriteFruits.get("Alice"));
    }
  }
```

So this works OK; the program outputs Alice's favourite fruit as expected.

Notice that we're initialising the HashMap as being empty, then using the `.put()` method to add keys and values.

However, if we build our project, rather than just running it, you might notice that the compiler is giving us a warning.

```
Choose Build > Build Project
```
> Note: If the warnings don't appear as expected, it can be introduced by doing the following:

* Introduce a blatant error
* Build > Build Project
* The errors list will appear
* Fix the blatant error
* Build > Build Project
* Cmd + 0  (Command + zero)
* Should now be able to see the warning from the compiler.

```
Note: HashMapDemo.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
```

The compiler is warning us that we should specify the _types_ of the keys and values we are putting into the HashMap. Let's try again.

```java
  // HashMapDemo.java
  import java.util.HashMap;

  public class HashMapDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      HashMap<String, String> favouriteFruits = new HashMap<String, String>();

      favouriteFruits.put("Alice", "Apple");
      favouriteFruits.put("Sarah", "Banana");
      favouriteFruits.put("Bob", "Strawberry");

      System.out.println(favouriteFruits.get("Alice"));
    }
  }
```

Much better! Now Java will complain loudly if we try to set the key or value to anything other than a String.

## Keys

A note about HashMap keys: you can use any class as a key, provided that it implements the `.equals()` and `.hashCode()` methods. In the example above, `String` fits the bill, but we can use any class that implements these two methods.

## Values

When you store a value in a HashMap, it will always store an object, rather than a primitive type. Take a look at the following code.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    HashMap<String, Integer> ages = new HashMap<String, Integer>();

    ages.put("Alice", 52);
    ages.put("Bob", 24);

    Integer aliceAge = ages.get("Alice");

    String output = "Alice's age is " + aliceAge.toString();
    System.out.println(output);
  }
}
```

Because the value of Alice's age is a full integer object, we can call `toString()` on it. (We couldn't do this if it was a primitive type!)

## Methods

Let's take a look at some of the most common methods we can call on our HashMap:

```java
  favouriteFruits.put(key, value) // inserts a new entry into the HashMap
  favouriteFruits.get(key) // gets the value for the given key
  favouriteFruits.size() // returns the size of the HashMap as an integer
  favouriteFruits.clear() // clears all entries from the HashMap
  favouriteFruits.containsValue(value) // returns true if the HashMap contains the value
  favouriteFruits.remove(key) //removes the entry with the given key
```

### Task

1. Create a HashMap of keys and values for the populations of some countries. Here is some sample data (don't forget to think about the types of your keys and values!):

```
UK: 64,100,000
Germany: 80,620,000
France: 66,030,000
Japan: 127,300,000
```

2. Output some values from the HashMap using `.get(key)` and `system.out.println()`.
3. Investigate the use of the `.values()` and `.keySet()` methods on HashMap.
